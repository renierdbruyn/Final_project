          <h1>Don't take it personally</h1>Criticism can often bring out the worst in people. It’s important for you to realize that being criticized is not a personal attack; it’s a key to success. Yes, success. When you’re criticized for a task, your employer is simply being honest with you. Use their criticism as a learning tool. Their knowledge could help make your work exceptional if you accept and consider their criticism. Here’s how to handle criticism like a pro.

<h1>Your first reaction is trouble</h1>

We’re human and our first reaction to criticism is often defensive. Avoid the urge to lash out and say the first thing that comes to mind. Rather take a step back from the situation, take a deep breath and think about what the other person has said. Is there truth in their words? If there is, implementing their suggestion may be very helpful to you.
<h1>Think positive thoughts</h1>
Criticism gives us a chance to improve. When you receive criticism always try to find the positive in it. Remember, honest feedback about your work is just one way that you can improve and be a better employee. Take the feedback into consideration and you’ll see that it could actually help you – and save your job.
<h1>Say Thank You</h1>
You may not want to at the time, but thank your critic for their honest feedback. It could help you feel less resentful and prove to them that you can actually handle criticism without losing control. You might even surprise them too.
<h1>Be calm</h1>
Sometimes criticism is far from helpful, but it’s up to you to be the bigger person. Don’t damage your career and throw your reputation down the drain by lashing out and insulting the other person. Don’t stoop to their level; respond in a calm, friendly manner and show them, and others, that you will not let your anger or their petty insults get the better of you.
